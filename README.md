# ParticleSandbox

A tool with which a user may provide an initial state (including a set of particles to begin with and values for relevant variables associated with the beginning state) in order to simulate an evolution of that state using a quantum computer. The tool's output is a set of variables associated with a time evolution of the provided initial state.

## Features
