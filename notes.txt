ok i think i figured out the "how many particles are in the end state" thing.
it is fairly simple

```
if focus initial state == final state
    then same number of particles
else if focus initial state == focus +1 particle initial state
    then final state number of particles is initial state +1
else if focus initial state == focus -1 particle initial state
    then final state number of particles is initial state -1
... maybe continue on until we have tried +/- 5 or something?
```
